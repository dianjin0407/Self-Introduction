I am an aspiring Business Analytics professional with a passion for leveraging data-driven insights to make impactful decisions. Currently pursuing an M.S. in Business Analytics at Boston University's Questrom School of Business, I am slated to graduate in December 2024. My academic journey has been complemented by a strong foundation, holding a B.S. in Marketing from George Washington University.

With experience as a Social Media Account Manager and a track record of successful project collaborations, I thrive on solving complex challenges and driving growth through innovative strategies.

I am thrilled to connect with fellow professionals, share insights, and explore collaborative opportunities in the realm of business analytics and beyond. Let's connect and embark on a journey of innovation and growth!
